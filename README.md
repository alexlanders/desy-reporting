# desyREPORTS
This project was created as a capstone project for the Python Full Stack Bootcamp as a part of the PDX Code Guild in Portland, Oregon.

desyREPORTS is a Django-based dashboard for reporting statistics gathered by Desy (Driver Ed Systems), an app by Drivers By Design. It's designed for program administrators to evaluate the effectiveness of Driver Ed curriculum and instructors.

### Usage

The app is designed to report input provided by a tablet-based application (Desy). New input can be manually populated using the built-in Django admin as well.

### Expandability
Data is served up to the app via a REST API that will allow other applications and other products under the DBD umbrella to access and display the data. Also possible to expand to third-party vendors (private driving schools, DMV, etc.).
